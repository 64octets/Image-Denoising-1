Instructions to use MATLAB scripts:
	1) Run WaveletShrinkageTest( <Input_Image_Path> ); to induce noise
		in a clean input image and see it denoise using several denoising
		methods like local average, median filter and wavelet shrinkage.
		Needs around 2 - 3 megapixel pictures to work properly.
		
	2) Run DenoiseYourOwnImageUsingWaveletShrinkage( <Input_Image_Path> );
		to remove noise from your input noisy picture using Wavelet Shrinkage.
		Needs around 12 - 16 megapixel pictures to work properly.
